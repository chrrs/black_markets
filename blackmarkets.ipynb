    "## Introduction and motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this analysis is to gain a better understanding of the black market. This ranges from seeing what kind of items and services are being offered, the general price ranges, the different sellers and their inventories, and what items we find most surprising. In addition to this we will attempt to classify the legality of the items identified. Finally, we will show who we believe are the top sellers from the investigated sites in order as well as who are the top three sellers who should be investigated by the police."

    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "We used the site https://darknetone.com/markets/ to find a list of black markets located on the dark web. We acessed these websites using the Tor Browser, because they aren't accessible using your normal web browser. Some of the black markets required us to have a registered account. If this happened, we simply created a temporary throwaway account with no leads back to our real identities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we entered the black markets, we started browsing. We chose a random, but diverse list of items from the websites, and put them in the table, filling in the appropriate columns. In one of these columns, we noted down if we thought the _selling_ of these products is illegal, which we discussed in our group. If the legality is questionable, we put our reasoning why it could be illegal or legal in the additional notes column.\n",
    "\n",
    "While going through the posts, we select some of the posts we have chosen, and look at the seller. We look at some relevant information about the seller and put it in another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the top 10 sellers, we look at their amount of posts and the lowest cost to calculate what minimum revenue they would generate if each post would sell once. In addition to this we determine the top 3 sellers we believe should be investigated further based on how much harm their items can cause to other people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since these results are random by nature, repeating this analysis wouldn't give exactly the same results, but still very similar. There is a bit of objectivity in the Legality column, because this is based on how you interpret the law."

But if it doesn't contain any illegal methods, why would it be on the black market? What is the difference between this and any other (public) guide or video on YouTube that explains ways on how to get rich.\n",
    "- **Forged Xfinity Comcast Statement:** On first sight, this makes no sense. You would think an official statement from Xfinity or Comcast would we useless. But this can actually be used to prove to the respective company that you own, live at or in any other way are affiliated with the address listed on the statement. This can then be used to impersonate the house owner."

The black markets seam to be just be lowly regulated online marketplaces where yo can look for or offer nealy any service and if one site won't allow you to sell what you want you can just find one that will. While not everything sold on the sites are inherantly illegal many things are and most of what isn't is likely to be used illegally."
